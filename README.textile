h1. The IntelliJ Leiningen Plugin

This plugin integrates Leiningen into IntelliJ. It is supposed to work with both the Ultimate and Community Edition
of IntelliJ.

h2. Usage

Install the plugin via the plugin manager of IntelliJ. Then go to Settings > Leiningen and set up the location of
Leiningen. Now you can run Leiningen targets in the Leiningen tool window on the right side of the IntelliJ main
window by doubleclicking on the target name.

When you open a project that is having a project.clj file in it's root, it is automatically added to the list of
Leiningen projects in the Leiningen tool window. If you have multiple project.clj in your project tree (e.g. a
project with subprojects) you can add these manually by pressing the plus icon in the Leiningen tool window.

h2. Compiling the source code

Grab the latest version from http://github.com/derkork/intellij-leiningen-plugin. Open the leiningen-plugin.ipr file in
IntelliJ. To build the plugin you need to set up an IntelliJ SDK. I suggest using an IntelliJ Community Edition as SDK
base, to ensure that the plugin will run on the Community Edition as well.

Next you need to build the leiningen interop library which is written in Clojure. To do that, run lein jar in the projects
 root folder. You can use the leiningen plugin for this if you have installed it, otherwise you need to do it at the
 command line.

You can then select the Run Leiningen Plugin  run configuration to test your changes. To build a deployable Jar file,
select Build -> Prepare plugin-module "leiningen-plugin" for deployment. This will create a Jar file that you can deploy
into you IntelliJ plugins folder.

Patches can be submitted via email to janthomae at janthomae dot de or using GitHub's fork and pull request facility.
